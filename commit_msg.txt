fix: Definitive OrchardSelector search fix

- Add normalizeText() for accent-insensitive search
- Clean value binding (searchTerm only, never ID)
- Console logs for debugging search behavior
- Improved UX with animations and better empty states
- Show 15 results max with "type to filter" hint
- autoComplete/spellCheck disabled for cleaner input

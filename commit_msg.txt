refactor: Click-to-Search pattern for OrchardSelector

- Implement isSearching state for two distinct visual modes
- State A: Display button showing orchard name
- State B: Clean search input that never pre-fills with ID
- Use onMouseDown for selection before blur fires
- Input always born empty with searchTerm only
- Close button to exit search mode manually

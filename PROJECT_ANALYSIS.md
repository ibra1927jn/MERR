# Project Logic & Structure Analysis

**Date:** February 6, 2026

## 1. High-Level Architecture
The project is a **Vite + React (TypeScript)** Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for orchard management. It uses a **component-based architecture** with a strong separation of concerns between:
- **Pages**: Role-specific dashboards (`Manager`, `Runner`, `TeamLeader`).
- **Components**: Reusable UI blocks (`components/manager`, `components/modals`).
- **Services**: Business logic and external API handling (`services/`).
- **Context**: Global state management (`context/`).

## 2. State Management Logic
The application relies on React Context for global state, avoiding external libraries like Redux, which keeps the bundle size low and complexity manageable.

### **HarvestContext** (`context/HarvestContext.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Central hub for operational data (Crew, Bins, Stats).
- **Logic**:
  - **Real-time**: Subscribes to Supabase real-time channels (`bucket_records`) to update stats instantly when any user scans a bucket.
  - **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately upon action (e.g., `scanBucket`), then syncs with the backend.
  - **Offline Fallback**: Seamlessly switches to `offlineService` if the backend is unreachable.

### **AuthContext** (`context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Handles user authentication and profile loading.
- **Logic**:
  - Wraps Supabase Auth.
  - **Role Resolution**: Determines if a user is a `MANAGER`, `TEAM_LEADER`, or `RUNNER` based on the `users` table, resolving potentially conflicting roles (e.g., `bucket_runner` vs `runner`).
  - **Orchard Association**: Ensures users are linked to an orchard; if not, attempts to assign a default one.

## 3. Offline Strategy (Robust)
The project implements a "Local-First" approach, crucial for orchard environments with poor connectivity.

### **Offline Service** (`services/offline.service.ts`)
- **Storage**: Uses **Dexie.js (IndexedDB)** (Version 2) for high-performance storage.
- **Queue System**:
  - Actions are stored with a numeric sync status: `0` (Pending), `1` (Synced), `-1` (Error).
  - **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Items that fail after 3 retries (e.g., due to deleted picker or referenced data conflict) are marked as `-1` (Error) and moved out of the active processing loop to prevent infinite retry loops. `failure_reason` is recorded.
  - **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) used for transient network errors.
  - **Conflict Handling**:
    - **Data Integrity**: Foreign Key constraints (e.g., invalid picker_id) trigger a permanent failure state (-1), preventing the queue from stalling.
    - **Visibility**: `getConflictCount()` allows the UI to surface synchronization issues to the user.
- **Detection**: actively listens to browser `online` and `offline` events to trigger syncs automatically.

## 4. Role-Based Workflows

### **Manager Flow** (`pages/Manager.tsx`)
- **Dashboard**: High-level stats, velocity graphs, and financial estimates.
- **Crew Management**: Live leaderboard of pickers. Includes search and sorting.
- **Logic**: Direct read access to all aggregated data. Uses `database.service.ts` for heavy queries.

### **Runner Flow** (`pages/Runner.tsx`)
- **Logistics Focus**: managing bins and collecting buckets.
- **UI**: High-fidelity interface with large touch targets.
- **Logic**:
  - **Scanner Integration**: Uses camera to scan QR codes/Barcodes.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Instant visual feedback on scans (Success/Error modal).
  - **Offline-First**: Heavily relies on cached data and the offline queue, assuming connectivity is intermittent.

## 5. Database & Security
The backend is **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**.

- **Schema**:
  - `users`: Extended profile data linked to `auth.users`.
  - `pickers`: The workforce. Distinct from app users (pickers might not log in).
  - `bucket_records`: The core ledger of all work done.
  - `orchards`: Multi-tenancy support.
- **Security (RLS)**:
  - **Row Level Security** is enabled.
  - **Fixes**: Recent scripts (`fix_auth_errors.sql`, `fix_rls_final.sql`) addressed recursion issues where users couldn't read their own team members due to circular policy logic.
  - **Policies**: Strict separation—Runners can only create records; Managers can read all orchard records.

## 6. Code Quality & Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing used throughout (`types.ts`).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom animations in `index.css`.
- **Modularity**: Code is well-structured. New features are added as separate files rather than bloating existing ones (e.g., separate SQL scripts for fixes).

## 7. Known Limitations
- **Deep Conflict Resolution**: While the system handles "hard" conflicts (e.g., deleted records) via the Dead Letter Queue, "soft" conflicts (e.g., Manager and Runner editing the same field simultaneously) currently follow a "last write wins" server-side policy.
- **Map View Integration**: The `HeatMapView.tsx` exists but isn't fully integrated into the Manager dashboard.

## 8. Recommendations
1.  **Map View**: The `HeatMapView.tsx` exists but isn't fully integrated into the Manager dashboard.
2.  **Testing**: Unit tests exist (`*.test.ts`), but E2E testing (e.g., Playwright) would validate the offline flows better.
3.  **Error Boundaries**: Adding React Error Boundaries would prevent the white screen issues if a single component crashes.
